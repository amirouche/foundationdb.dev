around many stateful systems like HBase, Flink, Kafka, Pulsar and
lately ETCD. Pierre is currently working on the Managed Kubernetes.

He discovered FoundationDB last year, and since then he has been
particularly interested in it, notably with the development of two
layers: ETCD-Layer and Record-Store.

## Summary

The FoundationDB Record Layer is an open source library that provides
a record-oriented datastore with semantic similar to a relational
database, implemented on top of FoundationDB. It is highly used within
Apple by CloudKit, Apple’s cloud backend service to host billions of
independent databases, many with a common schema.

In this talk, we will dig into the paper and the library's concepts
and feature. You will also discover how to use the library from a
developer's point-of-view, with examples taken from ETCD-Layer and
Record-Store.
