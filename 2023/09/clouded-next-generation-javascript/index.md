[@ry](https://github.com/ry)'s new big, and source available project
is coming up: Deno. Deno wants to offer a big leap of progress over
NodeJS, hence the new codebase. Among other things, Deno is built for

that cloud there is a persistence layer powered by FoundationDB: "a
zero-config, globally distributed database for free".
